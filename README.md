# Spacecraft-Quaternion-Control

This code simulates the rotation of a spacecraft starting at some initial attitude and angular velocity to another attitude and angular velocity, using an amount of torque commanded by a quaternion-based sliding-mode guidance law. There are no polar singularities. Examples of outputs can be found in the .fig files.
